\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Basics}
The company PlanFabrik GmbH creates floor plans for house technology. In a first step the plans are analysed and enhanced through an employee. He adds more information to the plan, like room polygons or he marks areas where house technology can be installed and where not.
\newline
\newline
This process is currently tool supported but still takes a lot of time, equal to the rising amount of rooms the employee has to analyse. The idea is to create a more automated system which does require only a small amount of user input.

\section{Goals}
The goal of this bachelor thesis is to create a software which automatically analyses architectural floor plans and simplifies them. Using the simplified plan, the software should recognise the room walls and calculates the polygons for the rooms. This information should be exportable to an existing calculation software.
